With the launch of this new community site, we've published a two part series on publishing apps with CASA.

* **[Part 1. Basic publishing](/learn/tutorial/publish/)** shows how to publish apps with CASA with nothing more than a JSON file. It breaks down the basics of the CASA payload structure, explains how identity and attributes are defined, demonstrates how to use a few common attributes, and concludes by explaining how to publish a set of apps on a web-accessible server.
* **[Part 2. Dynamically publishing](/learn/tutorial/publish/dynamic/)** explains how to map metadata in your app to an endpoint that speaks CASA. To do this, it uses source code examples two open source implementations of endpoints, namely CASA on Rails and EduAppcenter.

These articles, as well as additional ones that will be drafted in coming weeks, may be found in the [Learn](/learn) section of this site. Want to help us add to this list of resources? [Hit us up on GitHub](https://github.com/IMSGlobal/casa).
