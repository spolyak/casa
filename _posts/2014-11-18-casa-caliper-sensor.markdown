During the [IMS Global's November Quarterly Meeting](http://imsglobal.org/nov2014FLVS.html) at Florida Virtual School, the CASA and Caliper working groups presented their proposal for a proof-of-concept to capture information about content discovery and insertion, as occurs when LTI tools are added to a consumer either manually or through CASA.

From a working draft of the proof-of-concept proposal, which will be published soon:

> The Community App Sharing Architecture (CASA) enables institutions to deploy app stores for their communities, populated with a rich ecosystem of free and commercial apps sourced from other institutions, vendors and publishers. CASA on Rails, an implementation of CASA, takes this a step further by implementing the LTI Content-Item specification. With one click, an instructor can add an LTI tool from CASA on Rails directly into their course.
>
> While CASA on Rails with LTI Content-Item integration is an enabling for faculty, staff, students and publishers, it also has a couple problems: (1) the University has no idea which content is being added to which courses, nor how it is being used, limiting it in everything from privacy policy enforcement to contract negotiation; and (2) publishers have no metrics on how their content is propagating through the CASA network, and how effectively it is showing up in search results, being viewed and actually added/launched.
>
> This proof-of-concept will add a Caliper sensor to CASA to track how content spreads through the CASA network, how often it is found and viewed, and when it is actually added to a consumer or launched directly out of the store. For tools that also leverage Caliper internally, this sensor will also allow for a better aggregate understanding of user behavior and app uses.
