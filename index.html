  </header>

  <p>The Community App Sharing Architecture (CASA) enables institutions to deploy app stores for their communities, populated with a rich ecosystem of free and commercial apps sourced from other institutions, vendors and publishers.</p>

  <p>This is a community site that hosts information about the CASA protocol and common attributes, open-source implementations, hands-on tutorials, and more. There's still a lot under construction, so please bear with the dust, but feel free to check out our highlights and browse around.</p>

  <h2>Where to start?</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong><a href="learn/tutorial/publish">Publishing an App with CASA</a> ( <a href="learn/tutorial/publish">Part 1</a> &amp; <a href="learn/tutorial/publish/dynamic">Part 2</a> ) [ Article ]</strong> is a two-part series that introduces how applications are described with CASA, and then goes on to explore how CASA on Rails and EduAppCenter dynamically manage and publish apps via CASA.</li>
    <li><strong><a href="implementations/casa-on-rails">CASA on Rails</a> [ Implementation ]</strong> is a simple, easy-to-use, open-source app store developed by UCLA. It presents an storefront for finding and selecting apps, implements the <a href="http://imsglobal.github.io/casa-protocol" target="_blank">CASA protocol</a> for publishing and discovering apps, provides a mobile app dashboard using <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/webstorage" target="_blank">Web Storage</a>, and supports integration with learning management systems through <a href="http://www.imsglobal.org/lti/ltiv1p2pd/ltiCIMv1p0pd.html" target="_blank">LTI Content-Item</a>.</li>
    <li><strong><a href="http://imsglobal.github.io/casa-protocol">CASA Protocol</a> [ Specification ]</strong> defines the actual modules of the CASA Protocol. Not the best starting point for the feint of heart, but to get straight to the meat of CASA, there's no better place.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Open Source, Open Standard, Open Community</h2>

  <p>The Community App Sharing Architecture is a collaboration between the <a href="http://imsglobal.org" target="_blank">IMS Global Learning Consortium</a>, <a href="http://oit.ucla.edu" target="_blank">UCLA</a> and others in the tech community. The open standard, and its open source implementations, are completely a product of their contributors, and so any ideas, input, code or bug reports are greatly appreciated. Don't hesitate to check out the <a href="community">Community</a> section if you're interested in participating.</p>

  <p>Just as CASA is an open source, so is this website. If you'd like to offer content, feel free to let us know by <a href="https://github.com/IMSGlobal/casa" target="_blank">submitting an issue or a pull request on GitHub</a>.</p>
