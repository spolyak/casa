title: Reference Implementation
permalink: /implementations/reference/
---

This reference implementation implements the CASA Protocol as of the May 2014 draft. This implementation satisfies the latest version of the CASA Protocol, but it's architecture does not mirror the latest draft's organization and includes several structures no longer required or recommended by the protocol. As such, it should not be considered up-to-date as a reference implementation, even though it is a valid implementation of the protocol.
